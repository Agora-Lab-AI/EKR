Here's a simplified architecture to accomplish this task:

Data Preprocessing: A module to read and preprocess various types of input data (e.g., text, images, audio, video) and convert them into a standardized format for further processing.

File: data_preprocessing.py

Embedding Generator: A module to convert the preprocessed data into multi-modal embeddings using pre-trained models (e.g., OpenAI models for text, image, audio, and video embeddings).

File: embedding_generator.py

Embedding Storage: A module to store the generated embeddings in an efficient Parquet format. This module should provide functions to save and load embeddings from the storage.

File: embedding_storage.py

Elysium: The main class that integrates the Data Preprocessing, Embedding Generator, and Embedding Storage modules. This class should provide a high-level interface for users to generate and store embeddings.

File: elysium.py

Main Script: A script demonstrating the usage of the Elysium Knowledge Repository, including importing the necessary packages, specifying the input data, initializing the Elysium object, generating embeddings, and saving embeddings to a Parquet file.

File: main.py

README: A file providing an overview of the Elysium Knowledge Repository, its features, requirements, installation instructions, and usage.

File: README.md

With these files and modules, you can create a functional prototype of the Elysium Knowledge Repository. Each module should be implemented according to the specific requirements and objectives outlined in the description.
