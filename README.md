# Elysium Knowledge Repository: Embedding the Wisdom of Humanity üèõÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Elysium Knowledge Repository**! Utilizing the principles of the ancient Greeks, this advanced solution converts all of humanity's wisdom into multi-modal embeddings, preserved and stored in an efficient Parquet format.

## Features üöÄ
- Convert diverse knowledge sources into multi-modal embeddings
- Efficient data storage with Parquet format
- Easy integration with OpenAI models
- Versatile usage for AI, machine learning, data mining, and other applications

## Getting Started üåü

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI API Key
- NumPy
- Pandas
- PyArrow
- Nomic
- Tenacity
- Dotenv
- Concurrent

### Installation
Install all necessary libraries with the following pip commands:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas pyarrow nomic tenacity python-dotenv concurrent
```

### Usage

You can start embedding humanity's wisdom by following the steps in the main Python script:

```python
# Import the necessary Python packages
import os
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
from elysium import Elysium

# Load your OpenAI API key
dotenv.load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Specify your knowledge source file
file_path = 'path_to_your_file'

# Initialize the Elysium embedding object
elysium = Elysium(file_path)

# Generate the embeddings
elysium.generate_embeddings()

# Save the embeddings to a Parquet file
elysium.save_to_parquet()

# Verify the generated embeddings
elysium.verify_embeddings()

# That's it! Your wisdom is now embedded and stored efficiently!
```

## How it works ‚öôÔ∏è

The Elysium Knowledge Repository works by reading your knowledge source file (such as a CSV file), converting the information into multi-modal embeddings using [Pegasus](https://github.com/kyegomez/Pegasus) models, and storing these embeddings in a highly efficient Parquet format. It also provides capabilities to load and verify the generated embeddings, ensuring your wisdom is accurately preserved.

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

We aim to create a repository capable of embedding every type of multi-modal data, a mammoth task broken down into the following steps:

1. Develop and implement robust text embedding capabilities.

2. Expand our functionality to handle image data. This will involve creating image-to-embedding transformations.

3. Add functionality for audio data embedding. This will include developing a method for translating sound waves into a numerical representation that can be used for embeddings.

4. Incorporate video data embedding capabilities. This will require a combination of our image and audio data embedding strategies.

5. Extend our repository's functionality to handle sensor data. This can include data from IoT devices, biomedical sensors, and more.

6. Incorporate the ability to handle mixed data types within a single source. This is particularly useful for data sources such as scientific articles that contain text, images, and tables.

7. Develop a method for handling real-time data streams. This will enable us to provide up-to-date embeddings that reflect the most recent data.

8. Create an API for the Elysium Knowledge Repository. This will allow users to interact with our service programmatically and integrate it into their own applications.

9. Continuously optimize and refine our embedding processes. This includes improving efficiency, accuracy, and coverage.

10. Regularly update the repository with new data sources, keeping our stored wisdom current and comprehensive.
